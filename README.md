# Hey!

You can call me Jono. I generally contribute to projects where I'm experiencing papercuts, it's a great way to experience a wide range of different approaches to creating great software. I'm always excited to be wrong, and overjoyed to delete my own code.

You can find my musings [on my blog.](https://dickinson.id/). I don't post as frequently as I should. I work for a really great company called [Capital Markets Gateway](https://cmgx.io/), who are just a great bunch of peers and leaders. I'm the jack of all trades at the virtual office, but I'm mostly focusing on streamlining our CI right now. At work you'll find me using C#, JS, and a little Rust.

You'll find more of my personal projects over at [GitLab.](https://gitlab.com/jcdickinson). I've been playing around with Silverblue/Kinoite lately, so I have some kernel build scripts. I'm also writing a pgsql connection pool in Rust.

## Have an awesome day!
