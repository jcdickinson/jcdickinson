# Hey!

You can call me Jono. My pronous are "he / him / his". I generally contribute to projects where I'm experiencing papercuts, it's a great way to experience a wide range of different approaches to creating great software. I'm always excited to be wrong, and overjoyed to delete my own code.

I'm currently working on these:

* porkg: A Nix-like that aims to address some shortcomings I've seen in Nix. https://github.com/porkg/porkg
* Termkit: A VT100-502 library that attempts to "assume nothing" about the terminal. https://codeberg.org/jcdickinson/termkit

## Have an awesome day!
