# Hey!

You can call me Jono. My pronous are "he / him / his". I generally contribute to projects where I'm experiencing papercuts, it's a great way to experience a wide range of different approaches to creating great software. I'm always excited to be wrong, and overjoyed to delete my own code.

I work for a really great company called [Capital Markets Gateway](https://cmgx.io/), who are just a great bunch of peers and leaders. I'm the jack of all trades at the virtual office, but I'm mostly focusing on streamlining our CI right now. At work you'll find me using C#, JS, and a little Rust.

I'm currently working on these:

* Nickelpack: A Nix-like that aims to address some shortcomings I've seen in Nix. https://github.com/nickelpack/npk
* Termkit: A VT100-502 library that attempts to "assume nothing" about the terminal.

## Have an awesome day!
